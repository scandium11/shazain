    <h1>Samsung Galaxy S2</h1>
    <p>Samsung Galaxy S2 was unveiled on 13th of February 2011 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was one of the slimmest smartphones of the time, it was 8.49mm thick, it had a 1.2GHz dual-core "Exynos" system, it had 1 GB of Ram with a 10.8cm (4.3 in) WVGA Super AMOLED Plus Screen display.The Samsung Galaxy S II uses a 108.5-millimetre (4.27 in) WVGA (800 x 480) Super AMOLED Plus capacitive touchscreen that is covered by Gorilla Glass with an oleophobic fingerprint-resistant coating. The display is an upgrade of its predecessor, and the "Plus" signifies that the display panel has done away with Pentile matrix to regular RGB matrix display which results in a 50% increase in sub-pixels. This translates to grain reduction and sharper images and text. In addition, Samsung has claimed that Super AMOLED Plus displays are 18% more power efficient than the older Super AMOLED displays. Some phones have display issues, with a few users reporting a "yellow tint" on the left bottom edge of the display when a neutral grey background is displayed.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II">All Information coming from this Wikipedia Website</a>.</p></p>
